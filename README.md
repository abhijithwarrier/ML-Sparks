# ⚡ ML Sparks 📊✨
**_Your weekend guide to mastering Machine Learning, one spark at a time_**

A collection of **hands-on Machine Learning scripts** built using Python — perfect for learners, developers, and data enthusiasts.  
This repository is part of the **Saturday ML Sparks** Instagram series, where we explore **core ML workflows** and **real-world techniques** in simple, practical scripts.
